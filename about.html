            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>Sid's Sweetness began in my home kitchen, fueled by a craving for the authentic tastes of my Cameroonian heritage and a desire to share that comfort with my community.</p>
                
                <p>What started as baking for friends and family has grown into a small business built on one simple principle: every treat should be made with the same care and love as if I were serving it at my own table.</p>
                
                <p>My mission is to bring a little sweetness and a lot of joy to your life, one traditional recipe at a time. Each batch of chinchin, every peanut cookie, is crafted with authentic Cameroonian techniques and the finest ingredients.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for supporting my dream and allowing me to share these tastes of home with you.</p>
